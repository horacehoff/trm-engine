## About The Project

![Screen Shot](screenshot-rounded.png)

trm-engine is a game engine designed to run in the terminal, providing a simple and lightweight platform for developing terminal-based games.

Key Features:

- Object Management: The engine includes an object management system, allowing for easy creation, manipulation, and movement of game objects within the terminal window.
- User Interaction: The engine captures user input events, such as key presses, allowing for player interaction and game logic implementation.

trm-engine provides a simple and flexible platform for creating games in the terminal, making it ideal for hobbyist game developers or those looking to learn game development concepts in a lightweight and accessible manner.

## Built With

- Rust: trm-engine is implemented using the Rust programming language, known for its focus on safety, performance, and concurrency, making it well-suited for developing high-quality and efficient applications.
- crossterm: trm-engine utilizes the crossterm library, a cross-platform terminal manipulation library for Rust, which provides an easy and convenient way to interact with the terminal, including terminal size control, cursor manipulation, and event handling.
- fastrand (optional)
- Various custom modules: trm-engine includes custom modules for rendering, utility functions, text manipulation, object management, and shape generation, providing a modular and organized structure for the engine's implementation.
